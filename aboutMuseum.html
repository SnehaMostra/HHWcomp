    <h3>
        <p>In the classroom, educators can present information to students many ways,
             whether via lecture, video, or readings. Field trips can not only entertain,
             they also serve as a supplement for material discussed in class. Physically
             surrounded by elements that they have previously been taught allows students
             to connect the visual with their class experiences. When both iterations of 
             the same information are merged, a complete understanding of the subject matter
             is more easily achieved by the student, allowing them to successfully further 
             their education.</p>
