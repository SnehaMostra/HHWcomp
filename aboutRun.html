        <p>The purpose of the marathon is to ensure good health for the students.
         Hosting a school marathon challenge may be just the spark you need to get 
         your students and school community up and moving. You are probably thinking 
         completing a really long marathon seems like a crazy idea! But you don't have to do it 
         alone. Team up with friends and family for this marathon challenge, and 
         support each other along the way.</p>
